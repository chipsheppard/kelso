== Anything else I should know? ==

Gutenberg column blocks:
Add the css class "boxed" to a Columns Block to style the columns in nice boxes.
Add "bdr" to add a border.
Add "shade" to add a shadow.
Add the class "up100" to push a column up for a staggered look - up50, up75, up125, up150, up160, up175 & up200 are also available.

Horizontal Rule: If NOT using the WP Block Editor...  the horizontal rule tag (hr) is 10% black.  Add class=“alt” for 50% white.
Blockquote:      If NOT using the WP Block Editor... citations go in 'cite' tags. A 'span' tag inside the 'cite' tag will unBold the text.
Buttons:         If NOT using the WP Block Editor... you can make a link into a button by placing class="btn" into the anchor tag. Or class="btn secondary" to reverse link/hover the colors.

Other utility styles if NOT using the WP Block Editor:
ta-right - text-align = right
ta-center - text-align = center

Other utility styles:
mobile-only - will only display on devices 768 pixels wide and lower.
desktop-only - will only display on devices 769 pixels wide and greater.
